    <p>
        A classic cuban sandwhich that slaps! You'll never be able to eat a plain ham
        and cheese ever again.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 loaf Cuban bread</li>
        <li>8 slices Swiss cheese</li>
        <li>6 thin slices smoked fully-cooked ham</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups cooked pulled pork, heated</li>
        <li>1 large dill pickle, sliced thinly lengthwise</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix mayonnaise, mustard, and cayenne together in a bowl to make sauce.</li>
        <li>Spread each half on both sides generously with mayo-mustard sauce.</li>
        <li>
            Divide sandwich ingredients between the two bottom halves in this order:
            2 slices Swiss cheese, 3 slices ham, hot cooked pork, pickle slices, and
            2 more slices Swiss cheese. Place tops on sandwiches.
        </li>
        <li>
            Melt butter in a heavy skillet over medium heat. Place sandwiches in the
            skillet and press down with a heavy weight, such as another skillet or
            foil-wrapped bricks. Toast sandwiches until bread is crisp and filling is
            heated through, 3 or 4 minutes per side. And then enjoy!
