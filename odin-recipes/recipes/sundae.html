    <h3 class="title recipe_title">Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            The first step is to prep the strawberries. Wash and dry them,
            then cut off the green tops. Slice them into roughly ½ inch slices.
            Place 1 pound of the strawberries in a medium saucepan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Along with the berries, add the granulated sugar, lemon juice,
            pinch of salt and ¼ cup water.
        </li>
        <li>
            Simmer the strawberry mixture, stirring occasionally, until the
            strawberries have released some liquid and are softened.
        </li>
        <li>
            Then, mix together the cornstarch and remaining 1 tablespoon water
            together until the cornstarch is completely dissolved in the water
            with no lumps. Add this cornstarch slurry to the berry mixture and
            continue to cook for 1 - 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            After simmering for 1 - 2 minutes, stirring occasionally, the liquid
            in the sauce should be glossy and slightly thickened. It won't be super
            thick, more like the consistency of syrup. Let the sauce cool for a
            minimum of 10 minutes, it will continue to thicken as it cools.
        </li>
        <li>
            When you are ready to enjoy your strawberry sundae, start by adding a
            scoop of the strawberry ice cream topping into the bottom of a sundae
            glass (or small bowl, whatever you have on hand). Add a scoop of
            ice cream, and top off with even more strawberry sauce. And ta dah!
